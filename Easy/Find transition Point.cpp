Given a sorted array containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {0,0,0,1,1}
Output: 3
Explanation: index 3 is the transition 
point where 1 begins.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {0,0,0,0}
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, there is no "1",
the answer is -1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function transitionPoint() that takes
array and N as input parameters and returns the 0 based index of the position where "0" ends and "1" begins. If 
array does not have any 1s, return -1. If array does not have any 0s, return 0.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 500000
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1 */

int transitionPoint(int arr[], int n) {
    // code here
    int l=0,r=n,mid;
    while(r>=l) // Binary Search iterative method
    {
        mid=(l+r)/2;
        if(arr[mid]==1 && arr[mid-1]==0) 
        return mid;
        if(arr[mid]==0)
        l=mid+1;
        else
        r=mid-1;
    }
    return -1;
}


//Solution 2: using linear search

int transitionPoint(int arr[], int n) {
    // code here
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[i] == 1)
          return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
